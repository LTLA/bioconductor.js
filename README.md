# Bioconductor objects in Javascript

This package aims to provide Javascript implementations of [Bioconductor](https://github.com/Bioconductor) data structures for use in web applications.
Much like the original R code, we focus on the use of common generics to provide composability, allowing users to construct complex objects that "just work".

## Quick start

Coming soon.
